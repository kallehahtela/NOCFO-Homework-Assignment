# Running The 'Plant Photo App' 

1. clone the repo
2. move inside the folder
3. code .
4. npm install
5. npm start

Also this will use Expo so Expo Go is a relevant for testing with your own mobile phone

# Why I build it the way I did?

- I had some experience before building mostly front for these mobile apps by TypeScript
- I use fairly alot conditional rendering. (something ? some else : some else again)
  This will help for my perspective to make sure the code is much more easy to maintain and read.
- For storing data I am using a AsyncStorage library which I had some knowledge of using beforehand,
  At the frontend part to display the data I was using the <FlatList /> to get best solution I knew.
- Navigation were done by using React Navigation for simple and fast iteration.
- Icons were from expo icons which can be found more on https://icons.expo.fyi/Index

# This may not be the finest and best from UI / UX perspective

- This app has atleast one bug which I have been faced with, which occurs after you add a new plant.
- It can be manually fixed from code by refeshing the app (pull refresh) won't work atleast for me.
- This is a best of which I was capable to do within the 6 hours time limit.
- Main functionalities were some part new to me e.g. the picture taking implementation.
